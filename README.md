# CITS2002 Project 1 - 2019

The aim of this project was to simulate a processor running a set of processes using a simplified 5-State Model of Process Execution. The result of this simulation could then be used to determine the best time-quantum for minimising total execute time. The original project description can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20191027134019/http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/project1.php).

This project was completed for CITS2002 "Systems Programming", a computer science unit at The University of Western Australia.

## Possible improvements

The code originally submitted meet all of the projects technical requirements, however it did contain some stylistic issues. Namely it is inconsistent with variable declaration within functions, and some variables/functions are global when they do not need to be.

Currently the code contains these errors.
